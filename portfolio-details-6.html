              <h2>Miracle League of Arkansas Redesign</h2>
              <p>
                Miracle League of Arkansas sought assistance with a redesign of their current website in which I, along with two other classmates were assigned as a team to assist them. After being assigned to this client, we quickly started collaborating as a team and assigning roles that showcased our strengths.<br><br> I was assigned as the client liaison and project manager. My duties mostly entailed scheduling/hosting meetings with the team and client, ensure that all deadlines were met, contributed to the design of two web pages, and performed testing of the website to ensure all elements were valid and working.<br><br>

                Some of the challenges we faced were being able to determine what her actual needs and wants were. The client's main focus was on having a redesign that was not overwhelming and organized. She was not able to see the name and contact information when someone donated so that she could send them a thank you card in the mail. This issue was corrected along with using a PayPal widget to accept reoccurring donation payments.<br><br>

                Another challenge we faced was organizing her sponsors, events, and donations correctly because she had some overlapping information that could have possibly gone in another category, but she did not want that; so we offered the best suggestion and advice that we could possibly give her and were able to compromise on a solution to re-categorize them into either donors, sponsors, or events.<br><br>

                One memorable challenge we faced is closer to the time to present the website to our client, I had a death in my family and had to travel out of state to attend the services. We established at the beginning of the project that speaking and presenting was not my teammates strong suit. I did not want to leave my team hanging, so I recorded a presentation presenting my part of the presentation so all they would have to do was present their part.<br><br> It worked fine, at first, but the day of the presentation, technical difficulties arose, so while I was in the airport during layover time, we worked the technical difficulties out; only for the sound not to work. I was disappointed that it didn't work effortlessly, but I gave my team as much support as I could give.<br><br>

                This experience gave me a strong indication of how it will be once I graduate. We have to be able to research ideas and solutions to the problems we may face. We must exercise patience and flexibility at all times in order to meet the needs of the client to the best of our ability.
